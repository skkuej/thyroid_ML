    <p>Prediction for distant metastasis in follicular thyroid carcinoma: A radiomics study based on thyroid ultrasound</p>
</h1>
#### key words : thyroid, svm, machine learning, lasso


### Objectives
This experiment aimed to evaluate whether __radiomics analysis based on gray-scale ultrasound (US) can predict the distant metastasis in follicular thyroid cancer (FTC)__. Using radiomics features performed by matlab, the radiomics signature from thyroid ultrasound is an independent biomarker for predicting distant metastasis in FTC noninvasively.

### Tasks
We extracted a total of 60 radiomics features derived from the first order, shape, gray-level co-occurrence matrix, and gray level size zone matrix features using US imaging. A radiomics signature was generated by using the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator and further used to train a support vector machine (SVM) classifier in five-fold cross-validation. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to determine the association of the radiomics signature, US findings, clinicopathological variables with distant metastasis. Another SVM classifier was built using significant variables from the multivariate analysis.
